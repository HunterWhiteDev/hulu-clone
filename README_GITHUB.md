### Notice: You need the you need to get the following keys from me:

STRIPE_KEY for `functions/.env`

API keys for `src/firebaseKeys.ts`.

Contact me at hunter.white1801@gmail.com to get them.

## Getting Started:

To get started, follow these steps:

1. run `npm install` at the root directory.
2. `cd` into `functions` and run `npm install`
3. create a file at `src/firebaseKeys.ts` and use the keys I gave you.
4. create a file at `functions/.env` and add a varriable called `STRIPE_KEY` and enter the Stripe API key I gave you
5. Once all the dependancies are installed and the API keys have been entered in their appropriate place, running `npm start` should spin up the local development branch

Note: the firebase keys and Stripe keys can be replaced with your own, if you so wish to test with your own Firebase and Stripe keys
